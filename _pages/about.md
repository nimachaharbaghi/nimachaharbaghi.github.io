### About me

I'm currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Bologna, where my work centers on wireless communication systems, signal processing, and emerging network technologies. I am involved in research focused on 5G systems, contributing to the setup and development of a dedicated laboratory environment.

My academic journey began at Isfahan University of Technology, where I earned my Bachelor's in Telecommunications Engineering. During that time, I developed a strong interest in signal processing through a thesis on hand gesture recognition using mmWave radars. This project sparked my fascination with radar systems and strengthened my skills in real-time algorithm design and problem-solving.

My interests lie at the intersection of wireless systems, AI-driven networks, and cybersecurity. I’m especially passionate about contributing to the evolution of intelligent and resilient communication infrastructures.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring the broader world of technology, working on hands-on projects, and diving into the theory behind the systems we use every day.
